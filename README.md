# Credit Card Spending Habits in India
# Objective:
In this SQL project, our objective is to gain insights into credit card spending habits in India through SQL queries.

# Data Source from Kaggle
Credit Card Transactions Data: The dataset used for this analysis is "credit_card_transaction.csv" file, containing detailed information of each transaction made by Users in particular of period of time.

# Tools Used 
- Excel
- SQL Server Management Studio(SSMS) - Data analysis
- Power BI - creating Reports

# Specifically, we aim to:
- Identify patterns and trends in credit card transactions.
- Determine the highest amount spent in transactions.
- Analyze spending behavior over time, focusing on transactions placed in particular months.
- Utilize aggregations, common table expressions (CTEs), and subqueries to extract valuable insights from the data.

# Analysis:
To achieve our objective, we'll undertake the following analysis:

1. **Data Exploration**: We'll start by exploring the dataset to understand its structure and contents. This will involve examining the tables and columns available, as well as assessing data quality and completeness.

2. **Limiting Rows**: We'll use the `LIMIT` clause to restrict the number of rows returned by queries. This will help optimize performance and focus our analysis on relevant data subsets.

3. **Sorting**: We'll utilize the `ORDER BY` clause to sort transaction data and identify the highest amount spent in transactions. This will allow us to pinpoint high-value transactions and discern spending patterns.

4. **Transactions by Month**: We'll filter transactions to analyze spending patterns within specific months. This analysis will provide insights into seasonal variations in spending behavior and help identify trends over time.

5. **Aggregations**: We'll employ aggregation functions like `SUM` and `AVG` to calculate total spending and average transaction amounts. These metrics will serve as key indicators of overall spending behavior and transaction trends.

6. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: We'll define CTEs to simplify complex queries and enhance readability. This will facilitate the analysis of transaction data and enable us to perform more intricate calculations.

7. **Subqueries**: We'll utilize subqueries to retrieve data based on the results of other queries. This will enable us to conduct more detailed and nuanced analysis, extracting insights from multiple layers of data.

# Key Insights:
Through our analysis, we hope to uncover the following key insights:

1. **Spending Trends**: Identification of patterns and trends in credit card spending behavior, such as peak spending periods and popular transaction categories.

2. **Highest Spenders**: Determination of the highest amount spent in transactions and analysis of spending patterns among top spenders over time.

3. **Seasonal Variations**: Analysis of spending patterns within specific months to uncover seasonal variations in spending behavior and identify trends over time.

4. **Average Transaction Amount**: Calculation of the average transaction amount to gain insights into typical spending patterns of credit card users.

5. **Impact of Economic Factors**: Exploration of how economic factors may influence credit card spending habits, such as changes in interest rates or inflation.

6. **Recommendations**: Provision of recommendations for financial institutions or consumers based on key insights gleaned from the analysis, such as strategies for managing spending or optimizing credit card rewards.

Through this comprehensive analysis, we aim to provide valuable insights into credit card spending habits in India, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions and strategic plans in the financial industry.
